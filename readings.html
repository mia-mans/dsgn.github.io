                    </div>
                    <div id="r1">
                        <p>This text reminds me of the period during the pandemic when USPS was 
                            suffering and artists began using the mail more heavily to support them. 
                            I purchased postcards from artists who were charging no more than the 
                            postage cost and ended up finding pen pals online to send intricate 
                            letters to - I wonder if Carrion would have considered this more 
                            "Mail art"-y than the mail art he references? While both use the mail 
                            as simply a means of transport, the mail art that I interacted with 
                            was created solely with the purpose of using the postal system; an 
                            alternative method of transportation would have defeated the purpose of 
                            the art existing as it did. Similar to what Carrion says when discussing 
                            receiving something from a lover, the purpose of this art was in the 'mail' 
                            portion, not the 'art' portion.</p>

                    <div id="r2">
                        <p>My favorite website is the personal website of a post doc who I
                             work with. It's built as a choose-your-own-adventure page with
                              deliberate rendering of text. He told us that many of the faculty 
                              members disapprove of it, as it is inconvenient to click through 
                              the many paths to find his CV or wait for paragraphs of text to 
                              render. In that field, every person has one of three free CSS-templates 
                              as their website, and while yes, it is easy to find information because 
                              their websites are nearly identical, it also makes everyone extremely 
                              unmemorable from a quick google search.
                            <br>

                            I've always admired websites that have a dual purpose - that post doc's 
                            adventure game, a gsws thesis project posed as a murder mystery with hidden
                             hyperlinks, a software engineer's homepage that has interactive fridge 
                             magnets, etc. Schwulst's quote that "Each artist should create their own 
                             space on the web, for a website is an individual act of collective 
                             ambition" speaks to the process of thinking of a website more creatively, 
                             but I believe that it should apply to everyone who uses the internet, not 
                             just those who describe themselves as artists.</p>

                        <p>I appreciate Lialina's concept of 'ruins' vs moved pages vs 'alive' 
                            pages. In my mind, a website's status is based on its relevancy in 
                            todays world - Yahoo! is the most irrelevant search engine and I 
                            would almost consider it a ruin of the early 2000s, yet in the 
                            context of Geocities and Lialina's work in the archives, Yahoo! 
                            represents the future taking over as something even past an 'alive' 
                            page. I like the categorization of living pages as those whose 
                            contents all still work and links still exist; their functionality 
                            in our daily lives is insignificant compared to the importance of 
                            the content that they hold linking to a past era of the internet</p>

                        <p>The authors of this workbook strive to explain how and why to 
                            write alt text without writing a strict tutorial. They present ways to 
                            approach alt text more creatively, i.e. by using playful language reflective 
                            of poetry, while continually reminding readers that alt text is ultimately 
                            about increasing accessibility. The stress of both a creative aspect and 
                            utilitarian purpose of alt text is important â€“ in art and design spaces 
                            especially, it's easy to fall deep into the artistic side of accessibility 
                            and unintentionally neglect the original intent of allowing more people 
                            interact with your work.</p>

                             in my first year writing seminar, and my takeaways from that project align
                              heavily with Nasser's comments on internet accessibility for Arabic

                               from Western alphabets often cannot experience the internet in the
