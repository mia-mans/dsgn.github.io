                        <p>This text uses Disney as an example to examine how aesthetics and 
                            various eras of modernism have developed overtime, as Disney's 
                            iconography has spanned decades. Disney is often criticized as a 
                            corporate supergiant, and as a results, its text style and icons 
                            are often reworked by designers to criticize capitalism.</p>

                        <p>I am interested in how digital transmission of a physical performance 
                            work changes the piece. For example, how would String Games be 
                            perceived differently if it was watched in person rather than as a 
                            video performance? Are videos of a piece that can be replayed at 
                            anytime vs the original livestream airing treated similarly to 
                            seeing the real Mona Lisa vs having a print of it in your house, or 
                            does the fact that the artwork was recorded in the first place 
                            remove/lessen the connotation of a reproduction being somewhat 
                            disingenuous?</p>

                        <p>I was a big fan of this reading. Programming and CS in general are 
                            often posed as these exclusive, unattainable skills, and this reading 
                            does a great job of breaking down that invisible barrier. The tie 
                            between the selective memory of Black history and the way that computing 
                            forces us into thinking and acting a certain way is an innovative take 
                            that I think stands strong, and I appreciate this approach to thinking 
                            about programming. </p>

                    <div id="r8">
                        <p>In this work, Soulellis argues that the post, a static, singular 
                            disruption that garners attention, has evolved into a smooth flowing 
                            feed, where everything passes endlessly and seems to blend into itself.
                             He claims that automation and AI generated content have ruined the 
                             post, first through livestreams and eventually through artificial 
                             mindless, seemingly "off" content, but I beg to differ. While yes, this 
                             sector of unsettling artificial content has a strong internet presence, 
                             I don't think it has interrupted our daily lives enough to fully erase 
                             the post. (I got severely distracted reading through the James Bridle 
                             article, but I had never come across any of that kind of content on 
                             Youtube and the billions of views on those videos are often also 
                             automated). Even in the social media feeds that we endlessly scroll 
                             through, each post is unique enough and different from the next that 
                             I would argue it still constitutes what Soulellis considers the post. </p>

                        <p>Boris Groys: Art on the Internet</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="r10">
                        <p>This reading poses the internet as having radically changed art, both 
                            in its presentation and in its production. I agree with Groys that 
                            virtual museum collections or photographs of art pieces act as 
                            documentation rather than the art piece itself and therefore change how 
                            viewers interact with the piece, but how does this apply to art made for 
                            the internet? Web art exists in a vastly different space than art 
                            created before the internet, and in the same way that an internet 
                            expression of a physical art piece is tampered with by online expression, 
                            web art loses some of its integrity when displayed as physical images of 
                            the page rather than in an online space.
